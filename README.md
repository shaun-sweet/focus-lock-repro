# focus-lock repro

this is a repro for the issue reported on the npm package `focus-lock` https://github.com/theKashey/focus-lock/issues/36

# Steps

- clone repo
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

I created a button to toggle between a working example and a non working example. I know this is using a different library but it seems the issue is localized to this downstream package, hence opening an issue there!
